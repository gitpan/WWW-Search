WWW::Search
-----------

WWW::Search is a collection of Perl modules which provide an API to
WWW search engines like AltaVista, Lycos, Hotbot, WebCrawler, and so
on.  Currently WWW::Search includes the generic library, a back-end
for AltaVista, and a small demonstration program to drive the library.
Back-ends for other search engines and more sophisticated clients are
currently under development.

WWW::Search requires Perl5 and libwww-perl.
For information on Perl5, see <http://www.perl.com>.
For libwww-perl, see <http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/>.
Both are also available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). Visit <http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN
site near you.


AVAILABILITY

The latest version of WWW::Search should always be available from
<http://www.isi.edu/lsam/tools/WWW_SEARCH/>.


INSTALLATION

In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.002 or
better.  You install WWW::Search, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of WWW::Search in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl


DEMONSTRATION

By default the client program is not installed.  You can run it by:
	perl ./CLIENTS/search.pl '"lsam tools"'


DOCUMENTATION

See WWW/Search.pm for an overview of the library.
POD-style documentation is included in all modules
and scripts.  These are normally converted to manual pages and
installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should also be
able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation from the
module files directly.


SUPPORT

Question about how to use this library should be directed to 
<johnh@isi.edu> at this time.
