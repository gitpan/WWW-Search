WWW::Search
-----------

WWW::Search is a collection of Perl modules which provide an API to
WWW search engines like AltaVista, Lycos, Hotbot, WebCrawler, and so
on.  Currently WWW::Search includes the generic library, a back-end
for AltaVista, AutoSearch (an program to automate tracking of search
results over time), and a small demonstration program to drive the
library.  Back-ends for other search engines and more sophisticated
clients are currently under development.


AutoSearch
----------

WWW::Search's primary client is AutoSearch.  AutoSearch performs a
web-based search and puts the results set in a web page.  It
periodically updates this web page, indicating how the search changes
over time.  Sample output from WWW::Search can be found at
<http://www.isi.edu/lsam/autosearch/>.  Output format is configurable.

See the man page for AutoSearch details, or Demonstration section
below for the quick-start instructions.



Requirements
------------

WWW::Search requires Perl5 and libwww-perl.
For information on Perl5, see <http://www.perl.com>.
For libwww-perl, see <http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/>.
Both are also available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). Visit <http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN
site near you.



Availability
------------

The latest version of WWW::Search should always be available from
<http://www.isi.edu/lsam/tools/WWW_SEARCH/>.



Installation
------------

In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.002 or
better.  You install WWW::Search, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of WWW::Search in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl



Demonstration
-------------

After installing the client programs,
try
	search '"Your Name Here"'
to see who's talking about you on the web.

Then (in your web page directory), try
	AutoSearch -m 'me on the web' -q '"Your Name Here"' me
and the web page me/index.html will be created summarizing
this information.
Then add
	0 3 * * 1 AutoSearch /path/to/your/web/pages/me
to your crontab(1) to update this search once a week.



Documentation
-------------

See WWW/Search.pm for an overview of the library.
POD-style documentation is included in all modules
and scripts.  These are normally converted to manual pages and
installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should also be
able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation from the
module files directly.



Support
-------

Question about how to use this library should be directed to
