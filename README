WWW::Search and AutoSearch
==========================


WHAT IS NEW WITH WWW::Search 1.023?  (11-Dec-98)
------------------------------------------------
overview:  primarily bug fixes for back ends

- NEW: proxy support added to WebSearch and AutoSearch
	(based on code from Paul Linder)
- NEW: new back end for Snap.com (from Jim Smyser)
- BUG FIX:  Yahoo, HotBot, Excite, Lycos (from Martin Thurn),
	NorthernLight (from Jim Smyser)


WHAT IS WWW::Search?
--------------------

WWW::Search is a collection of Perl modules which provide an API to
WWW search engines.  Currently WWW::Search includes back-ends for
variations of AltaVista, Dejanews, Excite, HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos,
Magellan, PLweb, SFgate, Verity, WebCrawler, and Yahoo.  We include
two applications built from this library: AutoSearch (an program to
automate tracking of search results over time), and WebSearch, a small
demonstration program to drive the library.  Back-ends for other
search engines and more sophisticated clients are currently under
development.

Because WWW::Search depends on parsing the HTML output of web search
engines it will fail of the search engine operators change their
format (an unfortunately frequent occurrence).  WWW::Search includes a
test suite for most back-ends which verifies that it's functioning
correctly.  As of the day of the release the current back-end
status is:

AltaVista		working
Crawler			partially working
Dejanews		working
Excite			working
ExciteForWebServers	working
Fireball		working
FolioViews		working
Gopher			not working? (not in test suite)
HotBot			partially working
Infoseek		working
Livelink		not working? (not in test suite)
Lycos			working
Magellan		working
MSIndexServer		partially working?
NorthernLight		working
Null			working
PLweb			working
Search97		working
SFgate			working
Simple			not working? (not in test suite)
Snap			working
Verity			not working (not in test suite)
WebCrawler		partially working?
Yahoo			working

``Paritially working'' indicates that some tests passed and some failed.
Yahoo's test suites are sometimes flakey.

(others are currently under development, see contributors below for details)



WHAT IS AutoSearch?
-------------------

WWW::Search's primary client is AutoSearch.  AutoSearch performs a
web-based search and puts the results set in a web page.  It
periodically updates this web page, indicating how the search changes
over time.  Sample output from WWW::Search can be found at
<http://www.isi.edu/lsam/tools/autosearch/>.  Output format is configurable.

See the man page for AutoSearch details, or Demonstration section
below for the quick-start instructions.



REQUIREMENTS
------------

WWW::Search requires Perl5 and libwww-perl.
For information on Perl5, see <http://www.perl.com>.
For libwww-perl, see <http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/>.
Both are also available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). Visit <http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN
site near you.

At this time WWW::Search is tested under Perl version 5.004_04.



AVAILABILITY
------------

The latest version of WWW::Search should always be available from
<http://www.isi.edu/lsam/tools/WWW_SEARCH/>.  Alpha releases are only
available here (not at CPAN).

WWW::Search is also available as part of CPAN.  Visit
<http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN site near you.

Feedback about WWW::Search is encouraged.  If you're using it for a
neat application, please let us know.  If you'd like to (or have)
implemented a new back-end for WWW::Search, let us know so we don't
duplicate work.




INSTALLATION
------------

In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.002 or
better.  You install WWW::Search, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

See below for a description of what "make test" does.

If you want to install a private copy of WWW::Search in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl


TESTING
-------

The "make test" command compares expected output from WWW::Search with
actual output.  It detects two kinds of errors:

- internal parsing:
	First it checks to make sure that your system computes
	the same results from my system based on some saved 
	Web queries.  This test should always pass; if it doesn't,
	send me mail.

- external queries:
	Second, it makes real queries against the search engines
	and compares them with some saved results.

External queries can fail for several reasons:

- new pages have been added which match my test queries
	(not bad)

- changes in the web search engine output which break WWW::Search's
	parsers (very bad)

If the external tests fail, please either investigate the error or
send a description of the problem and the output of "make test" to the
maintainer of the back-end for the search engine that fails.  You can
find out who maintains the back-end by looking at the man page or code
for the back-end in the lib/WWW/Search directory.


DISCUSSION, BUG REPORTS, AND IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------------

A mailing list for WWW::Search discussion exists.  To subscribe, send
"subscribe info-www-search" as the body of a message to
<info-www-search-request@isi.edu>.

Back-end-related bug reports (search engine whatever doesn't work) should
be sent to the author of the back-end (back-end authors are identified
in the corresponding man page and the output of ``make test'').
General bugs should be reported to <johnh@isi.edu>.

When submitting a bug report, please remember to include
	- your version of perl
	- your version of WWW::Search
	- sample output showing the error
	- the output of "make test"



DEMONSTRATION
-------------

After installing the client programs,
try
	WebSearch '"Your Name Here"'
to see who's talking about you on the web.

Then (in your web page directory), try
	AutoSearch -n 'me on the web' -s '"Your Name Here"' me
and the web page me/index.html will be created summarizing
this information.
Then add
	0 3 * * 1 AutoSearch /path/to/your/web/pages/me
to your crontab(1) to update this search once a week.



DOCUMENTATION
-------------

See WWW/Search.pm for an overview of the library.
POD-style documentation is included in all modules
and scripts.  These are normally converted to manual pages and
installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should also be
able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation from the
module files directly.



FUTURE PLANS
------------

Some ideas:

  - application-level proxy support (I'm looking for a contribution
	here from someone who uses/needs proxy support)

  - more widespread use of new results tags across all back-ends

  - a freeze/restore interface to suspend and resume in-progress queries

  - more back-ends

Now that the test suite is done I don't plans to add major new
features, but contributions from others are always welcome.  Send me
e-mail if you plan a new back-end and to discuss architectural changes
(to avoid duplicating work).
