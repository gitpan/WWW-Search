    The begindetail/enddetail section describes how each row of output
    is be formatted.  The sample below prints:

        - record number
        - document title (if one exists) or virtual path of the file
        - the abstract for the file
        - the url for the file
        - the file's size and last write time
        - an HREF to the file for the hit highlighter.
          The parameters the hit highlighter include the CiQueryFile and
          CiTemplateFile. The CiQueryFile is not really needed as long as
          you don't have any custom properties. However, if you add custom
          properties, make sure the .idq file you use for queries is same
          as the one specified for CiQueryFile. The CiTemplateFile is used
          by webhits to format the output text.
